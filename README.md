# My name is Desterian Omwaga
#Yesterday got introduced to how git and github operates. I was taken through the entire installation process and the signing in till was fully convinient with it. I will like to say that i really loved working on it its simple and easy to learn working with git, the git clone, git status, git commit -m "", git push, git pull commands need to be mastered inorder to work smoothly with git.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning git ðŸ‘‹
